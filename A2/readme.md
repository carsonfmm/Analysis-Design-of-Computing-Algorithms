To run the programs P11.c, P12.c, P21.c, P22.c and main.c:
Enter: 'make all'

To execute the programs listed above:
Enter: './A2 (first_file).txt (second_file).txt'

The above commands will run all 4 programs and print the output to
stdout in the following order:
P11.c inversions and execution time
P12.c inversions and execution time
P21.c number of extreme points with co-ordinates and execution time
P22.c number of extreme points with co-ordinates and execution time

Limitations:
Assume points are of float data type
Assume files will not be larger than that of data_1.txt and data_2.txt

All design calculations, algorithms and comparisons are provided in the 'design.pdf' document
